# 📊 Supermarket Sales Dashboard: Comparing Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio, & R Shiny!
---
I recently worked with the 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭 from [Kaggle](https://lnkd.in/e3d5BqHg) and built dashboards using 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐮, 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈, 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐨, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐑 𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐲. Each tool has its own strengths, and I found that choosing the right one really depends on your needs, workflow, and technical skills.
### 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐞:
💡 𝐃𝐫𝐚𝐠-𝐚𝐧𝐝-𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩 simplicity in Tableau, Power BI, and Looker Studio makes building dashboards 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞, but each tool brings something different to the table:
 - ✅ 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐮: Offers a cleaner and more modern UI, with straightforward menus that enhance the user experience. It also has great storytelling features that make dashboards more engaging.
 - ✅ 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈: A powerful all-in-one tool with built-in data preparation features. The level of customization it offers is impressive.
 - ✅ 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐨: Super user-friendly and perfect for quick reports, especially if you're working with Google data. But compared to Tableau and Power BI, it lacks some advanced customization features.

⚡ 𝐑 𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐲: The Most Challenging Yet Most Flexible
Unlike the others, 𝐑 𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠—so it’s not as beginner-friendly. But once you get comfortable with it, 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐯𝐢𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐧𝐨 𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝.
